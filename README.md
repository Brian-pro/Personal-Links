# Personal-Links
This will be a personal project that I will be creating to have user be able to create an account, login, and have a page that displays as many links to their personal webpages as they desire. This idea came about because I want to attempt to learn account creating for webpages so that I can implement it into my previous repository project "Project-MAMB" (An all encompassing DnD player/dm tool).
